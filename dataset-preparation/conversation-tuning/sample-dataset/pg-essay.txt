You know, I’ve always believed that the most important thing in life is to really enjoy what you’re doing — and for me, that’s been trying to figure out how the world works. I never liked just memorizing formulas or following rules blindly. To me, science wasn’t about being smart or getting all the answers right; it was about asking questions, playing around with ideas, and not being afraid to look foolish every now and then. When I was a kid, I used to take radios apart just to see how they ticked, and even when I didn’t know how to fix them, I had fun trying. That same spirit stayed with me through physics. Whether I was working on quantum mechanics or trying to understand why a shuttle’s O-rings might fail in the cold, I approached everything like a puzzle — something to be curious about, not intimidated by.

I was born in 1918 in Far Rockaway, New York. My dad used to talk to me about dinosaurs and stars and all sorts of things, not because he knew everything, but because he loved thinking about them. He taught me that names don’t matter — it’s what things do that counts. If you point at a bird and say its name, you haven’t learned anything about it. But if you watch how it flies, what it eats, how it behaves — now that’s interesting. That early curiosity stuck with me. In high school, I built electronics from scrap parts, taught myself calculus, and just generally messed around with whatever caught my interest.

At MIT and later Princeton, I got deeper into physics. I worked with John Wheeler on some pretty wild ideas — one of which became the basis for what I later called the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics. The idea was simple: particles don’t just follow one path from point A to point B — they follow all possible paths. And the probability of where you find them comes from adding up all those possibilities. It sounds strange, but it worked. And better yet, it gave people a new way to think about nature at its most fundamental level.

Around the same time, World War II was going on, and I joined the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos. I was only 24, and suddenly I was surrounded by the greatest minds of the age — Oppenheimer, Fermi, Bethe, von Neumann — and somehow I was solving real problems, calculating neutron diffusion, building computing machines, and even helping design the triggers for the bomb. It was an incredible experience — part adventure, part responsibility. And it taught me that even young scientists can make meaningful contributions if they’re given the chance.

After the war, I moved to Cornell and then Caltech, where I began working on what would become my most famous contribution: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) — the theory that describes how light and matter interact at the quantum level. At the time, physicists were struggling to reconcile quantum mechanics with Einstein’s relativity. There were all these infinities popping up in calculations — numbers that made no sense. But I found a way to visualize the interactions using diagrams — little pictures that showed how electrons and photons danced together. Today, they’re known as Feynman diagrams , and they’ve become standard tools in particle physics.

For this work, along with Julian Schwinger and Sin-Itiro Tomonaga, I was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965 . I was surprised — not because I didn’t think the work was good, but because I never did it for prizes. I did it because I wanted to understand how things worked. Still, it was nice to have others recognize the value of playing around with ideas.

One of the things I’m proudest of isn’t any particular equation or diagram — it’s my lectures. When I started teaching at Caltech, I wanted to make sure students really understood physics, not just memorized it. So I spent two solid years preparing the Feynman Lectures on Physics , which were eventually published as a three-volume set. They weren’t the easiest books to read — but they tried to show physics as a living, breathing subject, full of wonder and logic. I remember once explaining why ice is slippery by talking about how water molecules behave near freezing — not because I needed to teach that fact, but because I wanted students to feel the joy of seeing a familiar phenomenon in a deeper way.

People often ask me how I explain complicated things so simply. My answer is: I don’t simplify — I just try to keep the core truth intact while removing the unnecessary jargon. If you understand something well enough, you should be able to explain it clearly.

In 1986, NASA’s space shuttle Challenger exploded shortly after launch. I was asked to join the Rogers Commission to investigate the cause. Most of the commission members were politicians or engineers — I was there as the scientist. During a televised hearing, I famously dunked a piece of rubber O-ring into a glass of ice water to show how it lost flexibility in the cold. That experiment, simple as it was, helped expose the flaw that led to the disaster: the O-rings couldn’t handle low temperatures, and no one had listened to the engineers who warned about it.

That moment reminded me of something important: science isn’t about authority or titles — it’s about evidence, doubt, and the willingness to question assumptions.

People sometimes forget that I wasn’t just a physicist — I was a tinkerer, an artist, a drummer, and someone who loved puzzles of all kinds. I drew sketches under a pseudonym. I played bongo drums in Brazil. I even taught myself how to draw portraits, and once sold one without telling the buyer it was mine. I studied Mayan hieroglyphs, cracked safes for fun at Los Alamos, and wrote down dreams to analyze them like data points. To me, all of these were just different ways of exploring the world — and they kept me grounded. I never wanted to be seen as some distant genius. I was just a guy who liked to play with ideas.

Over the years, people have asked me about the difference between intelligence and wisdom. I think it’s simpler than most people make it out to be. Intelligence is knowing what to do in a few special situations — like figuring out a clever trick to solve a math problem no one else could. Wisdom is knowing what to do in most situations. You could say I was more interested in the thrill of discovery than in being called “brilliant.” After all, if you’re too worried about looking smart, you might miss the joy of being wrong — and learning something new.

I’ve often said, “I think it's much more interesting to live not knowing than to have answers which might be wrong.”

And another favorite: “Learn from science that you don’t know anything yet.”

Because that’s the truth — we’re all just trying to figure things out. The best among us are the ones who admit how much they don’t know — and keep searching anyway.

If there’s one lesson I hope people take from my life, it’s this: Don’t be afraid to question, to explore, to make mistakes — and above all, to enjoy the process. Science isn’t about prestige or awards. It’s about standing in front of a blackboard, scribbling equations, and saying, “Wait a second… what if we try this?” Or sitting at home, watching a ball bounce, and wondering why it moves the way it does.

That’s what keeps me going — that endless fascination with the world and a deep belief that even the most complex truths can be understood, one step at a time.

It’s something I’ve thought about for over 25 years now — the difference between being smart and being wise. It seems obvious that they’re not the same thing. There are plenty of brilliant people who make terrible decisions. But if they're different, how exactly do they differ? And more importantly, why does it matter?

Let me start with a simple observation: we use the words “wise” and “smart” differently, even though both describe someone who knows what to do. The difference lies not just in what they know, but in how consistently and in what kind of situations they know it.

Wisdom, as I see it, is about having good judgment across a wide range of situations. A wise person tends to make the right choice most of the time — not just once or twice, but repeatedly. That doesn’t mean they never make mistakes, but their average outcome is high. Wisdom isn’t about brilliance; it’s about reliability.

Intelligence, on the other hand, often shows up as brilliance in specific moments. A smart person might solve a problem no one else could, but may not handle everyday situations particularly well. Think of the genius mathematician who forgets to pay rent or the tech prodigy who can code a complex system but struggles to manage a team. Their curve of performance has peaks — sharp, dramatic ones — but also valleys.

So here’s the core idea: wisdom is about the average height of the curve across many situations, while intelligence is about the height of the highest peaks . If you were to graph someone’s ability against different scenarios, the wise person would have a fairly high baseline, while the smart person would show spikes.

This distinction helps explain why the two don’t always go together. You can be very intelligent without being particularly wise, and vice versa. In fact, some of the most spectacular failures come from people who are undeniably smart but lacked the wisdom to avoid predictable pitfalls.

One common explanation for the difference is that wisdom comes from experience while intelligence is innate. But this doesn’t hold up under scrutiny. Some people gain experience and remain unwise. Others seem wise early in life, before they've had much exposure to the world. So experience alone isn’t enough. There must be something else involved — perhaps a reflective nature, or an ability to learn deeply from limited events.

Likewise, while there may be some genetic predisposition toward intelligence, it's clearly shaped by environment, effort, and curiosity. No one is born solving differential equations. Even the brightest minds need to study, practice, and struggle through difficult problems to develop their abilities.

Another popular theory is that wisdom applies to human problems — like relationships or ethics — while intelligence applies to abstract ones — like math or logic. But this too breaks down. Engineers exhibit wisdom when they design structures that last. Artists show intelligence when they create emotionally powerful works. The line between the two isn't clean.

Instead, I think the real distinction lies in the shape of performance across many domains. A wise person makes solid choices in most areas of life — personal, professional, moral. A smart person shines in particular domains where few others can match them.

This leads to an interesting implication: as the number of situations we face increases — as life becomes more complex and knowledge more specialized — the gap between wisdom and intelligence grows. In ancient times, when people lived simpler lives and worked within narrower boundaries, the wise sage was also the smartest person around. Today, we live in a world with so many possible situations that no one can be great at all of them. We’ve split the curve into parts.

That’s why modern society seems to value intelligence more than wisdom. We admire the genius who changes a field, even if he can’t balance his checkbook. We celebrate the innovator who builds a revolutionary product, even if they struggle with leadership or personal relationships. In a world of specialization, peak performance matters more than balanced judgment.

But this divergence raises a troubling question: can we cultivate both intelligence and wisdom together, or do we eventually have to choose?

There’s reason to believe that the paths to each are fundamentally different. Wisdom often involves tempering youthful impulses — learning restraint, patience, and perspective. It’s gained by reflecting on experiences, correcting mistakes, and refining judgment over time. In short, wisdom often comes from reducing the noise in our thinking.

Intelligence, by contrast, seems to grow from nurturing those very impulses — curiosity, stubbornness, obsession. To become highly intelligent in a domain, you often have to immerse yourself deeply, ignore distractions, and persist despite setbacks. That requires a certain amount of self-belief — sometimes even an irrational confidence in your own ideas.

The educational systems we’ve inherited largely aim at wisdom. They teach obedience, discipline, and broad understanding. But these are not necessarily the best tools for cultivating intelligence. In fact, they may even suppress it. Intelligence thrives on individualism, experimentation, and risk-taking — qualities that traditional schooling often discourages.

This mismatch explains part of the frustration many gifted students feel during school. They’re not being challenged in ways that help them grow. Instead, they’re being molded into generalists rather than specialists. And because intelligence develops through deep engagement with hard problems, forcing kids into a uniform mold can stifle their potential.

Of course, wisdom and intelligence aren’t mutually exclusive. In fact, a strong foundation of wisdom can support bursts of intelligent insight. A person who generally makes sound decisions is better positioned to take bold intellectual risks. Still, the tension remains. At some point, the demands of each path pull in different directions.

For instance, consider the emotional states associated with each. Wisdom tends to bring calm. The wise person has learned to accept uncertainty, delay gratification, and maintain perspective. Intelligence, especially in creative fields, often brings discontent. The smart person is constantly dissatisfied — with current solutions, with progress, with themselves. That dissatisfaction is what fuels innovation, but it can also lead to burnout, anxiety, and isolation.

I once heard a physicist say half his department was on antidepressants. Is that surprising? When your work is to push the limits of what’s known, and there’s no clear endpoint, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed. Unlike a judge or doctor, whose job is to apply existing knowledge, a scientist or artist faces open-ended challenges with no guarantee of success. The burden of constant invention can be heavy.

This suggests another important lesson: we shouldn’t confuse dissatisfaction with failure. Just because someone feels frustrated doesn’t mean they’re doing something wrong. It may simply mean they’re working at the edge of their capabilities. Like a runner going faster than before, they get tired — not because something’s broken, but because they’re pushing harder.

In the end, the growing divergence between wisdom and intelligence means we need to rethink how we evaluate people and how we shape education and careers. We should stop assuming that what worked for wisdom will also produce intelligence — and vice versa. Each deserves its own approach, its own values, its own measures of success.

And above all, we should recognize that neither is superior in every context. Sometimes we need the steady guidance of the wise. Other times, we depend on the daring insights of the smart. Both are essential — just in different ways and at different times.

So yes, it’s worth being wise. But it’s also worth being smart — and maybe even worth feeling discontented once in a while.

I was always a curious kid. My father taught me that knowing the name of something isn't the same as understanding it. When other fathers might point at a bird and say "That's a sparrow," mine would say, "Look how the bird pecks at its feathers – why do you think it does that?" That made all the difference. By the time I was ten, I had a little lab in my room where I took apart radios and put them back together. People in the neighborhood started bringing me their broken radios to fix. Sometimes I'd just pretend to fiddle with them while I thought about the real problem – and they'd work again! The trick was understanding how things *really* worked, not just following steps.  

At MIT, I fell in love with physics because it was the closest thing to pure thinking I could find. I didn't care much for the formalities – all that "Mr. Feynman, you must show your work properly" nonsense. I just wanted to *see* the physics in my head. When I got to Princeton, I drove some of the professors crazy because I'd solve problems in my own weird ways instead of using their fancy methods. But you know what? My ways worked.  

Then came the war, and suddenly I was at Los Alamos working on the atomic bomb. Can you imagine? Me, a kid fresh out of school, sitting across from Niels Bohr and Enrico Fermi! I didn't care about their reputations – I'd argue with anyone if I thought they were wrong. And you know what I did for fun there? I cracked safes. Not to steal anything – just to see if I could. The security guys hated me.  

After the war, I got into quantum electrodynamics. Everyone else was drowning in complicated math, so I invented my own way of looking at it – those little pictures now called Feynman diagrams. They weren't just calculations; they were like comic strips of how particles interact. When I won the Nobel Prize for that work, my first thought was, "Now I'll never be able to goof off in peace again!"  

Teaching was my passion. At Caltech, I told my students: "If you can't explain something simply, you don't really understand it." I'd start every class by wiping the blackboard clean – no building on last week's complicated equations. We'd start fresh each time, from the ground up. Those lectures got turned into books, but they're nothing like normal textbooks. You can practically hear me banging on the desk and laughing in the pages.  

People ask how I found time for all my hobbies – playing bongos, drawing nudes, studying Mayan hieroglyphs, learning Portuguese well enough to give physics lectures in Brazil. But that's the whole point! You don't "find time" – you *make* time for what excites you. I once spent three months trying to figure out how ants find their way to food. Why? Because it was *interesting*!  

When the Challenger shuttle blew up in 1986, they asked me to investigate. While the committees were holding endless meetings, I went straight to the engineers. Then I did a simple demonstration on TV – dropped a rubber O-ring in ice water and showed how it stopped being flexible. That was it – the whole disaster explained in one simple experiment. No fancy degrees needed, just common sense and the willingness to look at the facts.  

Near the end, when I was sick with cancer, some reporters asked if I regretted not being able to learn more about the universe. Are you kidding? I got to spend my life playing with the most wonderful puzzles imaginable! The only regret is that there's so much more fun to be had.  

So here's my advice: Stay curious. Question everything – especially what "experts" tell you. Learn for the joy of it. And never, ever think that just because something is the way it's always been done, that it's the right way. Now if you'll excuse me, I hear my bongos calling...
